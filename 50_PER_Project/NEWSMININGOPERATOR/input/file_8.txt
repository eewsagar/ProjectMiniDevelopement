Merry Christmas, dear Leo !! 
Today you may find yourself disappointed on a few fronts as a result of Mars opposition Uranus. You may find that the goals you set out for yourself today are not being met very easily and your productivity suffers. Do not worry about it; today is just one day and you will see improvements on all these fronts soon. Wear something in purple to instill confidence in yourself, say Astroyogi astrologers. Placing sunflowers at the entrance of your home will usher positivity in your home. If you have been waiting to reveal your true feelings to the one you love, today is the right day and 6.30 pm to 7.30 pm would be perfect for it.
