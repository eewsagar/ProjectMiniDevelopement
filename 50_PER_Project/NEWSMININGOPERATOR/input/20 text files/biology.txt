Our blood is a fluid that is also a type of connective tissue. It is composed of blood cells and an aqueous fluid known as plasma. Two major functions of blood include transporting substances to and from our cells and providing immunity and protection against infectious agents. The major components of blood include plasma, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.The image above shows three blood cell types: an activated platelet between a red blood cell (left) and a white blood cell (right). 
A central organizing concept in biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, and that all life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This last universal common ancestor of all organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.5 billion years ago.[20] Biologists generally regard the universality and ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes
Mantis shrimp tune the sensitivity of their UV photoreceptors using a unique application of filter pigments in the optical components in certain facets of their eyes. By combining four UV filters with two visual pigments in the photoreceptors, mantis shrimp achieve six UV spectral sensitivities—the most described in any animal. Surprisingly, these filters are composed of biological sunscreens, typically used in the skin of animals for photoprotection but specifically localized to the eyes in mantis shrimp, extending and diversifying their elaborate visual arsenal.
