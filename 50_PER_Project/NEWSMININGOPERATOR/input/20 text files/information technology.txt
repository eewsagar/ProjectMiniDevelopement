The Indian IT market currently focuses on providing low cost solution in the services business of global IT. Presence of Indian companies in the product development business of global IT is very meagre, however, this number is slowly on the raise. US giants that outsource work to India, do not allocate the high end SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) processes like requirement analysis, high level design and architectural design, although some Indian IT players have enough competency to take up and successfully complete these high level software jobs. The other prominent trend is, IT jobs, that were earlier confined to Bangalore, are slowly starting to experience a geographical diffuse into other cities like Chennai, Hyderabad and Pune. The growth is not fast paced, this, can be largely attributed to the lethargic attitude of the government in providing proper telecommunication infrastructure. The penetration levels are higher for mobile, but, the speed at which the backbone infrastructure works (network speed) and the coverage it offers are far below what other countries of the world have currently in offer.
