Actor Saif Ali Khan, who will be next seen playing a gun-toting outlaw named Raja Mishra in Tigmanshu Dhulia's Bullett Raja, recently lost his cool when the media lashed out at him for arriving late by 3-4 hours at a promotional event in Delhi.
Angered by the media's barbs, the Nawab lashed out, saying that he was late because of traffic issues and further claimed that he made a mistake coming to Delhi and that this would be his last visit to the capital. Saif also said that henceforth, he will give interviews only from Mumbai.
Bullett Raja, which also stars Sonakshi Sinha and Vidyut Jammwal, is slated to release tomorrow.
