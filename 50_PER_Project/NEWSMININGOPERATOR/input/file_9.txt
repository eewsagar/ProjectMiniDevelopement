Dear Capricorn, your relationship with a close relative takes a turn for the worse today, foretells Mars opposition Uranus. Do your bit in trying to make things better; to begin with, keep a strict check on the words that first come to your mind. Communicating helps, always. However, if you feel things have gone beyond your control, its best to take a step back and allow others to realize where the fault lies. Be sensitive to others feelings. 5 pm to 7 pm is lucky for you, say astrologers at Astroyogi. Number 1 will bring you financial gains. Merry Christmas!!
